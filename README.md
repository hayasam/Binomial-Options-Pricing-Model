# Binary-Options-Pricing-Model
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_options_pricing_model" target="_blank">Info on the Cox, Ross and Rubinstein paper.</a>
The purpose of this repository is to provide a more efficient method of generating binomial pricing trees based on BOPM.
My initial commits will include STEP 1 - 3 as described in the wikipedia article.

This method takes advantage of a recursive pattern in the binomial pricing matrices in order to reduce the number of floating point calculations by an order of n time steps in the tree.
